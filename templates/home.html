        <p class = "p1">My bachelor was a 5-year double degree in Communications and Information Engineering at Helwan University (Cairo, Egypt) & Uninettuno University (Rome, Italy), however, I chose elective courses related to software, such as Machine Learning and Embedded Systems, and also my bachelor’s Graduation Project was to design and efficiently implement in Java the class schedule (depending on the free time slots for each Professor and TA without making any conflicts, and also having a summer mode) & exams schedule (depending on the days chosen for exams and considering any exceptions or vacations without making any conflicts) for Communication and Information Engineering program in my college, maybe it was not the most efficient code but it did the job well with excellent results, I think I am good at algorithms in general, my bachelor degree GPA is 3.22/4 and also I was chosen for a 8 months Erasmus+ scholarship in Rome which was a great experience for me, and this led me to be accepted to the Computer Science Master’s degree I am studying now in the University of Oulu with a 75% tuition fee scholarship.
